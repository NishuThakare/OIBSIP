Task 1- Retail Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and recommendations based on findings.
Key Concepts and Challenges
1.	Data Loading and Cleaning: Import and preprocess the retail sales dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2.	Descriptive Statistics: Compute fundamental statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
3.	Time Series Analysis: Examine sales trends over time using time series techniques.
4.	Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key trends.
5.	Visualization: Present findings using bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to enhance data storytelling.
6.	Recommendations: Provide actionable insights based on EDA findings to improve business decisions.
Learning Objectives
•	Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
•	Develop skills in interpreting descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
•	Learn to use data visualization for effective communication of insights.
Technologies Used
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
•	Jupyter Notebook / Visual Studio Code
•	GitHub for version control and project sharing




Actionable Recommendations Based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This EDA project provides useful insights into sales, inventory, and store performance. Analyzing sales, revenue, stock, and pricing helps in managing inventory better and understanding demand trends. 
Time series analysis shows seasonal sales patterns, which can improve stock planning and promotions. Studying product performance helps focus on best-selling items while improving low-performing ones through better pricing and marketing. 
Store analysis identifies top-performing locations and areas needing improvement, ensuring better marketing and stock allocation. 
Managing store space efficiently and improving layouts can enhance customer experience and profitability. Finding relationships between key metrics helps in making smart decisions and improving forecasts. 
Regularly tracking key performance indicators helps businesses grow and stay competitive. These steps will help improve sales, store efficiency, and overall business success.
